Linear Regression:
Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
In the statistical summary, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and AWD provided a non-random amount of variance, while values for vwhicle length and ground clearance were very low (5.08xe^11 & 5.21xe^8).
Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
No. The p value is 5.35 x e^-11, which is a lot smaller than the significance level of .05
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
I believe the linear model does an ok job at predicting mpg because the multiple r-squared value is 0.71, meaning 71% of the time it is correct.

Suspension Coil Summary/T-Test:
The current manufacturing meets the design specifications of having a variance less than 100 psi
 since the variance is 62.3 pounds per inch. The suspension coils appear to be pretty standard. Both the mean and median
are approximately 1500, which is the same as the average population's. According to the t-test, there is a 95% confidence 
interval, and the p-value is 0.057% which is above the common significance level of 0.05%, meaning that we cannot reject the 
null hypothesis, so the two means are statistically similar.

The most important factors to customers when comparing the MechaCar prototype to other available models are
cost, fuel efficiency, mileage per year, and safety rating. We should ask how the mean of these factors compare to 
the means of vehicles on the market. We can also perform a linear regression to see how cost changes in reaction to
features like the ones stated above. The data that should be collected is how the protoype performs over a year in terms of
safety in reaction to obstacles, how many miles the car can go based on how much fuel is filled, and the mileage per year.
